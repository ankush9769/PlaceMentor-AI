# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI Interview Simulator is a web-based application that conducts spoken technical interviews using AI. The system allows users to select their preferred technology stack and difficulty level, then conducts an interactive voice-based interview where questions are generated by AI, spoken aloud via text-to-speech, and user responses are captured via speech recognition and evaluated for quality.

## Glossary

- **Interview Simulator**: The complete web application system
- **User**: A person preparing for technical interviews

- **TTS Service**: The OpenAI Text-to-Speech API that converts questions to audio
- **Speech Recognizer**: The browser's Web Speech API that converts user speech to text
- **Answer Evaluator**: The OpenAI GPT service that scores and provides feedback on answers
- **Interview Session**: A single complete interview from configuration to completion
- **Tech Stack**: The programming language or technology being tested (e.g., Python, JavaScript)
- **Difficulty Level**: The complexity tier (e.g., junior, mid-level, senior)

3. WHEN audio data is received THEN the Interview Simulator SHALL play the audio through the browser audio element
4. WHEN audio playback begins THEN the Interview Simulator SHALL display the question text on screen simultaneously
5. WHEN audio playback completes THEN the Interview Simulator SHALL enable the speech input interface

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to answer questions using my voice, so that I practice verbal communication skills.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the User activates voice input THEN the Speech Recognizer SHALL capture audio from the User microphone
2. WHEN the Speech Recognizer processes audio THEN the Speech Recognizer SHALL convert speech to text in real-time
3. WHEN speech-to-text conversion occurs THEN the Interview Simulator SHALL display the transcribed text to the User
4. WHEN the User completes their answer THEN the Interview Simulator SHALL send the transcribed text to the backend API
5. WHEN microphone access is denied THEN the Interview Simulator SHALL display an error message and provide alternative text input

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want my answers evaluated with constructive feedback, so that I understand my performance and areas for improvement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an answer is submitted THEN the Answer Evaluator SHALL assess the response on clarity, accuracy, and depth
2. WHEN evaluation occurs THEN the Answer Evaluator SHALL assign a numeric score from one to five for each criterion
3. WHEN scoring completes THEN the Answer Evaluator SHALL generate specific improvement tips based on the answer content
4. WHEN evaluation results are ready THEN the Interview Simulator SHALL display the scores and feedback to the User
5. WHEN feedback is displayed THEN the Interview Simulator SHALL show scores for clarity, accuracy, and depth separately

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want a visual interface that mimics a video call, so that the experience feels like a real remote interview.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the interview interface loads THEN the Interview Simulator SHALL display a video-call style layout with question area and controls
2. WHEN the interview is active THEN the Interview Simulator SHALL show a countdown timer displaying remaining time
3. WHEN audio is being captured THEN the Interview Simulator SHALL display an active microphone icon with visual feedback
4. WHEN displaying the interface THEN the Interview Simulator SHALL adapt the layout responsively for desktop and mobile devices
5. WHEN questions are presented THEN the Interview Simulator SHALL show the current question number and total question count

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to retry questions if I'm unsatisfied with my answer, so that I can practice until I improve.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an answer has been evaluated THEN the Interview Simulator SHALL display a retry button for the current question
2. WHEN the User clicks retry THEN the Interview Simulator SHALL replay the question audio
3. WHEN retry is activated THEN the Interview Simulator SHALL clear the previous answer and evaluation
4. WHEN the User provides a new answer after retry THEN the Interview Simulator SHALL evaluate the new response independently
5. WHEN retry occurs THEN the Interview Simulator SHALL not penalize the User or affect subsequent questions

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to work without complex server-side state management, so that it loads quickly and deploys easily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend receives a request THEN the Backend API SHALL process it without maintaining session state
2. WHEN generating questions THEN the Backend API SHALL return the complete question set in a single response
3. WHEN evaluating answers THEN the Backend API SHALL accept the question context within the request payload
4. WHEN the application is deployed THEN the Interview Simulator SHALL function correctly on Vercel serverless infrastructure
5. WHEN multiple Users access the system THEN the Backend API SHALL handle concurrent requests independently
